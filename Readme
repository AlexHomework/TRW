Matlab code to compare different Markov Random Field inference algorithms.
Supported algorithms:
Alpha-Expansion (C++ code by Olga Veksler and Andrew Delong)
TRW-S (C++ code by Vladimir Kolmogorov)

and various methods to maximizing dual function arising in Tree Reweighted Message Passing algorithm:
Subgradient ascent (with various 1-d optimization routines)
Bundle method
L-BFGS (Matlab code by Michael Overton)

Examples:
% Firstly get some data to play with
[unary, vertC, horC] = potentials('tsukuba');
% Use TRW-S for solving stereo matching problem
labels = TRW_S(unary, vertC, horC);
showImage(labels);
% Solve problem with various algorithms and draw comparative plot
figure;
hold on;
[labels, primal_energy, dual_energy, time] = bundleDual(unary, vertC, horC, 'bundleSize', 10);
plot(time, primal_energy, '-r');
plot(time, dual_energy, '-r');
[labels, primal_energy, dual_energy, time] = bfgsDual(unary, vertC, horC);
plot(time, primal_energy, '-b');
plot(time, dual_energy, '-b');
xlabel('Time (sec)');
ylabel('Energy');
